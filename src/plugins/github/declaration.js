    A references edge connects a GitHub post to a GitHub entity that it
    references. For example, if you write a GitHub issue comment that says
    "thanks @username for pull #1337", it will create references edges to both
    the user @username, and to pull #1337 in the same repository.

  description: dedent`\
    When a post in a particular thread mentions a particular user, that post
    will have a \`MentionsAuthorEdge\` connecting it to any posts written by the
    mentioned user. The intuition is that if a post is mentioning an author by name,
    their contributions in that thread are probably particularly valuable.

    This is an experimental feature and may be removed in a future version of SourceCred.
