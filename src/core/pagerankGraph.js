/**
 * PagerankGraph is a wrapper over the Graph class, which adds
 * the ability to run PageRank to compute scores on the Graph.
 *
 * Every node in the underlying Graph is assigned a numerical score in
 * the range [0, 1]. Provided that there are any nodes, the sum of all
 * the scores will be 1 (i.e. the scores are a probability
 * distribution). The scores are assigned by the [PageRank] algorithm;
 * i.e. a node recieves score in proportion to the score of its
 * neighbors. When the PagerankGraph is first constructed, the scores
 * are initialized to a uniform distribution.
 *
 * [PageRank]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank
 *
 * Every edge in the Graph is assigned an `EdgeWeight`, which includes a
 * `toWeight` (weight from the `src` to the `dst`) and a `froWeight`
 * (weight from the `dst` back to the `src`). Both `toWeight` and
 * `froWeight` must be nonnegative numbers. The weights influence how
 * score flows from node to node. For example, if the node `root` is
 * connected to `a` with a weight of `1` and to `b` with a weight of `2`,
 * then `b` will recieve twice as much score from `root` as `a` does.
 *
 * Every node in the PagerankGraph has an associated `score`. Provided
 * that the graph has at least one node, the scores are a probability
 * distribution over the nodes; i.e. every score is in the range [0,1]
 * and the scores sum to 1.
 *
 * This class is intended to closely mirror the Graph API so as to
 * present a consistent and familiar interface.
 *
 * At present, PagerankGraph does not support any modification to the
 * underlying Graph; doing so will invalidate PagerankGraph and cause
 * its methods to throw errors.
